How to run the application?
=======
Create a C# application that reads in book information, looks up additional metadata, and outputs details to a flat file.  You can download a free version of Visual Studio from here:  https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/.  After you are done, ZIP up and return the whole solution folder.
This application should take in the following command line arguments:
•	-Input=”<Path to Books.xml>”
•	-Output=”<Path to Output.txt>”
•	-E (indicates whether or not to log errors to file)
For example, the application may be executed as shown below, although the parameters could be in any order:


Example of how it works   Test.exe -Input="C:\Temp\Books.xml" -Output="C:\Temp\Output.txt" -E
